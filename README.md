# FloorPlan-DSL-Replication-Package
Replication Package for the MODELS 2023 submission on the FloorPlan DSL

### FloorPlan DSL models

The 6 FloorPlan DSL models used in the experiment are available [here](/experiment/floorplan-dsl-models/), these can be transformed into simulation-ready sceneries with the [FloorPlan DSL](https://github.com/sesame-project/FloorPlan-DSL). The task used for the experiment is specified [here](/experiment/task/left_long_corridor_task.yaml). The task is consumed by a component that publishes the goals, available [here](https://github.com/deebuls/navi_goals).

*Note: the complete environment models included in this replication package are a re-creation of a large section of a university campus; however, the task for the experiment presented in the paper was located at a specific corridor of this campus. For the tally of Table III and the Fig. 8 of the paper, any space or feature that was not relevant in the execution of the experiment was omitted*.  

### Interview Protocols

The unfragmented interview protocols are provided [here](/protocols/). These protocols are not verbatim transcripts from the interviews, but they accurately represent the discussion. The interviewed experts had the opportunity to review and correct the protocols before the analysis.

### Interview Fragments
 
The coded fragmented interview protocols are available [here](/fragments/). The list of codes utilised is also [available](/fragments/codes.md). The fragments are coded using [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) notation, and can be better visualised with it; but any text viewer can function as well.
