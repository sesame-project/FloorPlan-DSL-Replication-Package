Q: What environmental features would you like to simulate but are not currently possible?

A: Doors are challenging, specifically their behavior (open, close). Also interactions with people, so what happens when two people want to cross the same door and there is only space of one of them. Currently with open source simulators we don't have good models for simulating humans.
