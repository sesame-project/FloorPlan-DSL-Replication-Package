Q: Were these bumps between door frames? Or were there irregularities on the floor?

A: Sometimes the bumps were in the door, but the map assumes that it is very flat. These bumps are common, and you have to be careful. When mapping you would have to filter this and maybe assign a cost to these areas. Maybe even limit the speed when you are nearby a bumb.
