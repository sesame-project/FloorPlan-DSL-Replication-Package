Q: What could you say that the robot can perceive?

A: That would depend on what sensors are you using. But mainly distances: an odometry sensor is able to perceive the distance the robot has moved, a laser scanner reads the distances to solid objects, a camera can perceive the distances to landmarks. So in general the robot can perceive distances and landmarks.
