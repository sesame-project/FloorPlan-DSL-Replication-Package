Q: Would you consider the navigation stack robust against the environment?

A: Probably not complete robust, since the structure is very basic. It would be more robust if you have multiple SLAM algorithms (such as a backup SLAM module) for when the sensors are not good enough. There is room for improvement. With some higher level information, such as semantic information, can make the navigation more robust.
