Q: Can you describe in your own words where you would deploy the robot?

A: Most of them have been office environments, where you had not a lot of variations in altitude of the floor. So for the most part no ramps or stairs were present. The floor was carpeted or with normal title, and we didn't have trouble with them. Most of the walls were solid, and the most narrow corridor was at most 2 meters, so a person could walk (with the robot on the corridor). The doors would be 80cm wide.
