Q: What would you say are the challenges?

A: Navigation stacks nowadays are successful in moving the robot from point A to point B. But one of the main challenges is produce sociable acceptable behaviors in robots that operate in human-inhabited environments, such as hospitals, when navigating. Unpredictable behavior in robots lowers the trust in robots that must operate in this environments, causing annoyance and dangerous situations. Another challenge is the safety of the robot in certain scenarios, since robots have limited perception. They can cause harm to itself or to other elements of the environment.
