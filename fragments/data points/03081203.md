Q: What environmental features would you like to simulate but it is currently not possible?

A: The environment itself it is not that interesting on its own. Ignoring materials, you can introduce dynamic obstacles, not just random movement but modeling realistic behavior. Doors that open/close. So movement that is grounded in the real world. That would be good to have. You test in the real world because it is exposed to dynamic elements that are hard to simulate.
