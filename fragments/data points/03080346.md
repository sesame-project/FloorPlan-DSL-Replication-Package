Q: Would you say that the problem of simulation in indoor environments is solved?

A: Not at the moment. It depends on various aspects. One of them is that cost of the navigation components. Higher cost sensors lead to better performance overall. A lot of work have to be done in the software and hardware to reach a point where the problem of navigation can be considered solved, but problems will still exist.
