Q: What do you think is the impact of the map quality in the performance of the system?

A: The impact will depend on how robust the navigation stack is. If it relies too much on the grid map and the quality will impact the performance. The map is only one of the inputs to the internal model of the environment. For the current navigation solutions it does have an impact.
