Q: Can you think of other challenges?

A: Another challenge is about the kind of environments we simulate. For instance we don't simulate dark rooms, as the type of navigation you do is way different. Also communication challenges are interesting, one time I was controlling the robot with a joystick and the commands that were sent are not the ones that were executed. But we don't usually model this. One that might seem trivial is structures on the floor, in one case there was a sharp object in the floor that could harm the robot. There are a lot of aspects of the environment one must consider to navigate well.
