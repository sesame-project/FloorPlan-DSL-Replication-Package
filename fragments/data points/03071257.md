Q: Can you describe the environment where you have deployed the robot?

A: We have deployed it in environments with a variety of small to medium sized rooms connected with corridors, including very long corridors and open halls, so it is a very informed type of environment for testing. Also we have done test in different floors and basements for large similar buildings. This latter one was the most challenging. We have also deployed robots in industrial environments with large halls with sections where machinery is grouped together. And finally, a confined space where we do endurance tests.
