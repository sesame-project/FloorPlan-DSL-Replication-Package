Q: What is the impact of the quality of the map for the performance of the system?

A: There is an impact, if there is a discrepancy between what you see in the real world and the map this will degrade the performance. It really depends on the situation. To see the effect you need to see the entire system. For applications where you really rely on the map, the task will degrade.
