Q: How would describe the simulated environment when you compare it to the real world?

A: It was mostly the same. I made a replica of the real world environment so that I could save time and resources using the simulation.

Q: And to which level of detail did you model the environment?

A: To the level where windows where place, but sunglight issues were not possible to replicate. All of the walls were replicated.
