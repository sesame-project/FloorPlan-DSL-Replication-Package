Q: What can the navigation observe with its sensors?

A: Any material or surface that is made out of carton, wood, plastic, metal (although noisy), and others?. Some materials are less noisy than others. One that I'm unsure about is how the laser would respond to black coloured materials. Like we said before, lidars can only see obstacles on a 2D plane and not even 360 degrees, but rather a more limited FOV, depending on the lidar specs and the place in the base where is mounted. For our robot we had to place 2 lidars at 90 degree FOV and still had a blind zone at the side of the robot.
