Q: Do you think a software solution can deal with these challenges or do we need to modify the environment?

A: To some extend both. It depends on your platform. For some robots even if you have a ramp rather than stairs it is still difficult. I would still try the software solution. 3D navigation would probably have helped us deal with our issues.
