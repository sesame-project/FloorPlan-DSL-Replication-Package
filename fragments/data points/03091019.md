Q: Can you describe the environment where you deployed the robot?

A: Hospital, universities and homes.

Q: What were these like?

A: Hospitals had lots of hallways and rooms. The university is very diverse with lots of hallways, with a lot of glass walls which are hard for LiDAR systems to detect, and also metal walls instead of concrete walls. Home environments were the best environments to navigate around since they were small and statics.

Q: And did you have many features in the hospitals?

A: No, just long hallways.
