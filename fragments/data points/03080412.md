Q: Do you think a map that is too perfect will have a better or worse performance than a noisy map?

A: Depends on the navigation stack. For the classical navigation stack then it's better to work with a noisy map obtained from the sensors. If you attach semantic information to the map then you won't need a high accuracy map.
