Q: Would you say the navigation stack is robust against the environment?

A: If you refer that it will work in any environment, no. It depends a lot on the environment. For instance, a very large area where the robot cannot see any features, it is very difficult to navigate. In a very small environment with many features that are static, it is a solved problem.
