Q: Would you consider the navigation stack as robust?

A: Yes, at least on the environment where we tested

Q: What do you consider robust?

A: Robust means that it was possible to conduct many tests without failures, so the failure-rate was low and it was possible to conduct tests for longs periods of time without failures. I must say that there were many iterations to reach this point. It also required changes to the environment model on top of iterations of software.
