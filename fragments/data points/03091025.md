Q: Do you think a software solution can deal with these challenges? Or do you need to modify the environment?

A: Most of the time you can't modify the environment, but in general we can of course improve the software components.

Q: Is the solution comes only from software? Or do you need to improve hardware as well?

A: You can improve the hardware as well. Better sensors help, and better computation can help.
