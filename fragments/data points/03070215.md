Q: How do you approach testing? Is it simulation first or real world fist?

A: There is no direct answer, it mostly depend on the availability of hardware. But must of the time it is a co-development. For example, we went to an environment to create the map, we cleaned the map, and create a simulation environment. Both activities go hand by hand.
