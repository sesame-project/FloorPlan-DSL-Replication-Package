Q: What did the model of the robot entail?

A: I have worked with aerial robot, and it is hard to have a good model, for many conditions that are hard to simulate (ground effect, wall effect, ...). For ground robots you can have a more detailed model that is more accurate that can be exploited in the state estimation and simulation.
