So for a table it only sees the legs of the table, it doesn't see the surface. To prevent crashes, we would modify the occupancy grid. In the environment model there were subdivisions, and part of the semantic information was regarding forbidden areas. For example: stairs, and certain doors. But we didn't use this to deal with obstacles.
