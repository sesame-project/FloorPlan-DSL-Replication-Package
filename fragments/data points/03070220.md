Q: Do you have any closing remarks?

A: It is important to note that creating new environments are difficult to create. It should be possible to reduce the amount of time required to have an environment ready to simulate. It would be nice to also have variations of the environment. The easier it is to specify and obtain these environments, the better. It would also be nice if we don't need to specify every aspect, so we could say "we would like some clutter in this room" and get a room with a number of tables.
