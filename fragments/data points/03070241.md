Q: Can you describe in your own words the navigation stack?

A: The components depend on the task (e.g. follow humans or pick and place).

Q: But what about a particular case?

A: Localization based on distance sensors (2D/3D lidar), Map module (before navigating), planning (at a global level, unlike grid based planning, something more abstract), motion planning and control (for short durations)
