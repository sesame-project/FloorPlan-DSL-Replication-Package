Q: Can you describe in your own words the navigation stack of the robots you have worked with?

A: I have worked primarily with robots with laser scanners as inputs to a mapping software using open source software. They can generate 2D or 3D maps (such as occupancy grids or 3D point clouds). A localization component uses the maps with the laser data to localize the robot. The output for this component would be a 2D or 3D pose of the robot. Another component is a path planning software that returns a global path plan in your map, and a local path planning component helps you navigate in the local environment.
