Q: How would you describe the simulated environment.

A: You try to simulate the target environment to develop the high-level behavior of the robot, for instance move it to a certain place, and you try to make a simulation environment that is similar to the real world. Also, continuous integration tests try to recreate small situations for small automated test.
