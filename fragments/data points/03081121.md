Q: How would you describe the simulated environment?

A: In terms of testing, it is enough to have a simulation that recreates the real world. In terms of localization, simulation is not accurate because you cannot simulate the sensor noise. Since the sensor readings is tightly coupled with the results of the localization, then you have to test it in the real world. And in terms of the local planner, the simulation is just an approximation.
