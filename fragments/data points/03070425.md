Q: How would you measure robustness?

A: I would measure it by trying challenging scenarios, maybe introducing different test. Create a simple environment for a test, such as a static environment, and make it more complex by adding dynamic obstacles. Then we evaluate if the navigation stack can successfully complete its tasks. Then your qualitative measure of robustness would be knowing if the navigation stack can complete its task in a challenging environment.
