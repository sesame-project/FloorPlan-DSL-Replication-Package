Q: Would you say that the problem of robot navigation in indoor environments is a solved problem?

A: No.

Q: What are the challenges?

A: If you want to navigate you need to include planning and localization, in the high and low level. Most of the current modules rely in accurate localization, and use geometric representation to know where the robot is located. You plan a global path, and then try to stick on that plan with the use of local planners. So everything is very rigid. This is different in how we as human move around the environment. We think in terms on which directions we are going to move. This method is widely use, but it require very high localization that is hard to obtain, and once you have it you then have to try to stay in a rigid path where the robot will run into issues.
