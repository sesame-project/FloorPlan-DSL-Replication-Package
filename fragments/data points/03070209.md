Q: I notice the corridor is a bit curve, is this a drift problem?

A: Indeed. We asked for architectural drawings but these were not available. You can also see that there is no loop closures, there is no chance for the algorithm to handle that. As long as you stick to the map, the curvature is not really a problem.
