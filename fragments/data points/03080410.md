Q: Do you think a software solution can deal with these problems?

A: Certainly yes. I think if you can sense the environment and attach meaning to those measurements, you can distinct what were the changes that occurred so you can rely more on the static elements of the environment. You can also add hardware for redundancy, add beacons for localization, and reduce light sources. But this approach is costly and not reliable.
