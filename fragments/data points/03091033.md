Q: What is your reference to recreate a new environment?

A: I use the occupancy grid of the environment, and based on that I build walls. Depending on the use case I add objects.

Q: What type of objects do you add?

A: Depends on the use case, one example was a robot that works in a cafe so we added tables and chairs.
