Q: Have you ever recreate an environment in simulation?

A: Yes. But we know we are simplifying it.

Q: But is it challenging?

A: It depends on the purpose, for a simulator you first need to know why you are doing it for. For some purposes, you may not need a realistic environment, but to test the situational awareness you need a very accurate environment.
