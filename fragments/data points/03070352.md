Q: How would you measure robustness?

A: We don't have a single measure of robustness, we can have different degrees of robustness categories. We can have robustness in safety, task completion. For the previous example, we can quantify it by counting the times the robot collide with an object that is undetectable. 

[[Safety]]
[[Robustness]]
