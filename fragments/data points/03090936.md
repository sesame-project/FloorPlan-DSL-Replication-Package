Q: How would you describe the simulated environment

A: The simulated environment is a list of (sdf/urdf) models that are imported by the simulator, the models typically consist of visual, collision, inertia properties. CAD models can provide with the geometry and collision, for other properties the inertia tensor needs to be expressed, alongside the mass, etc. Apart from this list of models, you have general simulation properties such as gravity, friction, wind, etc. Another important aspect is the rendering, it is important for simulation of the perception modules. For my application low graphics is enough however nowadays photorealistic rendering can be useful to generate synthetic training data that is then later on transferred to the real system with ML techniques such as domain randomization.
