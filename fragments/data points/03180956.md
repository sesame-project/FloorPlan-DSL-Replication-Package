Q: Would a map that is noisy perform better than a "perfect" map?

A: I think the map taken by the robot will perform better. Hand drawing can be tricky because you need to consider the slice of the world the robot can see. On the other hand a map taken by the robot which is later on edited by an expert user would be best, in fact we were doing exactly that in one situation.
