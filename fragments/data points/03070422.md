Q: Can you describe in your own words the navigation stack?

A: From the base you have a robot that has sensor and wheel actuators. The robot sends the sensor information to a localization module, possible a SLAM algorithm, with sensor fusion or Kalman filter beforehand. When the sensor information reaches the SLAM module, you get localization for the robot. With a localize robot you can finish the loop by giving a goal position for the robot to move. There is a module that is able to read the robot's position and produce the velocity commands to reach the desired position. Overall this is what makes a navigation stack.
