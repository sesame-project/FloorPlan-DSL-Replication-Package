Q: How does this dynamic aspect affect the robustness of the navigation stack?

A: It mainly affects the localization, up to a certain degree. The more the environment changes the more likely you are to have a drift in the SLAM algorithm. At least, our navigation stack was quite good with obstacle avoidance.
