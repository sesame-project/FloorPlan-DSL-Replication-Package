Q: Would you consider this navigation stack robust against the environment?

A: Not completely. We were trying to make the navigation stack robust with semantic information. If you are in a hallway with a room, you notice there is a room with an open door, there is uncertainty that a person could come out of the room. This uncertainty requires semantic information to deal with it. A simple action is to slow down and try to see if something is coming. This type of actions are missing in the navigation stack.
