Q: What did the model of the platform entailed?

A: Simulation assumes that everything is perfect, which is reflected on the URDF file. This is not true in real life, there are always deviations from the drawings due to manufacturing imperfections which are addressed in a process called calibration. But more important is how you simulate the model, many of the available simulation models are very high level, so they do not simulate the wheel movement but rather they apply a force to the entire robot. Depending on where you apply this force, you can get sometimes weird behaviors; especially when you collide with something. The weird behavior stems from the simplifications made to the motion models, which are implemented like that to simplify the code as well as to speed up the computation and to consume less resources.
