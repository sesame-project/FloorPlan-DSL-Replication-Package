Q: What type of areas do you think are problematic?

A: I would say go to 3D poses in the environment, talking about 3D navigation. Motion planning in 3D is more challenging. The robot footprint shape is also important, if it's close to a circle then is ok, but the more different to a circle the more challenging it becomes to the navigation stack.
