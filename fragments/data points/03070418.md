Q: Would you say that the problem of navigation in indoor environments is a solved problem?

A: I would not say that is solved completely, there are unexpected situations that can occur. I have not seen an approach that is prepared to deal will 100% of possible situations, there is still a lot to improve with the navigation stacks that I have used.
