Q: What is different between the real world and the simulated environment?

A: Mostly in the simulated environment you start with a very static simulation. Where you include mostly the static elements of the environments, since dynamic objects are very hard to simulate. For simulating humans, there is a complex interaction between a person and a robot system that is hard to model.
