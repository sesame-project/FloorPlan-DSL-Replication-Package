Q: Did you found any bugs that were interested related to the environmental features?

A: Yes. we were testing mostly in two real world environments. One was the target environment, and another was very controlled. The scale was very different, but the both of them were large. So we saw different behaviors in both. one example is that tThe out-of-the-box ROS planner can't deal with long distances. The other one is the dynamic aspect of the target environment, which changed everytime we went there. This made localization break, as the occupancy grid is static and made from information captured at a certain height. The environment changed from hour to hour. There was no way to capture this dynamic aspect. The environment model developed for the project was based on the floorplan of the building, but they were too "perfect": no noise and sometimes different from the real world.
