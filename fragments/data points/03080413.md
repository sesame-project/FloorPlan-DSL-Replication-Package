Q: How do you approach testing? Simulation first or real-world first?

A: Simulation first. But you don't want to stay to much in simulation. You want to workout most of the things in simulation. In an application where the robot must have contact with the environment then it might be better to quickly move to the real robot. Physical interactions with the objects is very difficult to model and simulate.
