Q: What makes a landmark distinct? For a laser scanner.

A: The shape of the object being sensed. One thing that I have seen for a different part of the navigation stack is shape detection. You can use the shape as a reference, you can say that a landmark is a shape with a certain size. For cameras you can use the uniqueness of an object as the landmark, you can also use bitmap patterns as landmarks, and even visual odometry; but mainly pattern matching.
