Q: What can the navigation stack observe?

A: It depends on the type of sensor and where they are positioned. One robot had one laser scanner at the bottom, maybe at 30cm from the ground, it also had a camera at 1,4m off the ground. For navigation we used the laser information, and it gives you information that can only be seen at that height.
