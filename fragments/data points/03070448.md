Q: And do you think a map that is too perfect can be troublesome?

A: If it's perfect, probably. A map generated by the robot will have noise, but the noise comes from the sensors the robot uses to localize itself as well. A noisy map will work better than a map made out of a CAD model. A map generated by the robot will give me more confidence.
