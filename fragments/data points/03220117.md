Q: In terms of the spatial aspect, what do you think is problematic?

A: Depends on your sensor, a narrow corridor can be challenging for a lidar sensor, as the robot may not be able to localize itself in a corridor that looks the same. Specially if the environment does not have any texture, you will get lost even with vision based navigation. It can also be problematic for the lidar sensor to detect features in environments that are too large (e.g. a desert). If the robot is big, a narrow area is challenging. Steps are also hard to detect if the camera/laser is not pointing at the floor. It really depends on your sensor configuration, you need the right sensor for the right environment.
