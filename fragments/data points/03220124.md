Q: How would describe the simulated environment?

A: It depends on what we are testing, simulation is very generic. For VSLAM you need a photo realistic environment, for lidar you may not need so much detail but you need to provide some detail for features. For control you may not even need a realistic simulator. For trajectory planning it doesn't have to be realistic. So it depends.
