Q: Is this only for cameras or for other sensors as well?

A: Cameras are the most challenging, but this applies to other sensors such as lidar. We once recreate an environment and created a robot model with the sensors for simulation, and the simulated sensors produced way different measurements. The measurements were not the same as the ones for the real environment.
