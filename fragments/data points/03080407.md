Q: Was there something in the environment you did not expect?

A: There was one situation when we visited a space that was complete chaos. They sorted and moved metal parts around, and even you as a person would get lost inside the space. It was really dynamic with lots of hard-to-perceive objects. We ended up asking to move to a more structured place.
