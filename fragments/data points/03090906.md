Q: Have you worked on the navigation stack of a real or simulated robot

A: Yes. With both.

Q: Can you describe your role in the development process?

A: I was tuning the parameters of move base for the real robot for at least 6 months, to improve the robot navigation. By testing them on the real robot, observing the behavior, and modifying the parameters. Most of the problems with the YouBot navigation back then were due to a bad tuning of the parameters, plus some strong non-well understood assumptions made by move base (for example that they consider the robot as a circle). Many years later I also implemented from scratch some components of the navigation stack, such as the local, global planner, and differential drive kinematics, which is about mapping the body velocity to wheel velocity and computing the odometry.
