Q: What can the sensors detect?

A: A 2D laser can detect basic geometry information, parallel and perpendicular lines. A 3D lidar is able to detect more, it can detect planes, objects, even people. Then there are cameras that can, with a processing algorithm, detect anything. Depending on the sensor the navigation stack must be adapted to process that information.
