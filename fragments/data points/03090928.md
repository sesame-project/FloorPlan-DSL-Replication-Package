Q: Which elements do you think you need in order to describes the environment?

A: Platforms were the main element, maybe some machinery, like a conveyor belt or a rotating table. Tape was another element, which we had to detect to avoid crossing it. This was not detectable by the laser, but instead we used a rgb camera mounted on the robot arm. Sometimes an object can become an obstacle (e.g. if dropped by the robot gripper), and if the object is very small then it cannot be seen by the robot lidar and can potentially become a hazard to the wheels.
