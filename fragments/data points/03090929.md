Q: Was there something in this environment that was challenging?

A: Detecting the tape was challenging. Another issue was with the swedish wheels of the robot which generated lots of vibration. We were careful in building the robot mechanical additions robustly, e.g by 3D printing supports for the laser scanners later on attached via screws, such that the vibrations didnâ€™t became an issue.
