Q: Which elements do you think you need in order to describe these environments?

A: You need to describe the elements you want to be robust against. You don't want to describe all aspects, but you want to describe the walls, certain features that can help you with localization, particularly in environments that change often. You want to describe parts of the environment where you know there is some invariance. Any modeling has to consider this.
