Q: Would you consider the navigation stack as robust against the environment?

A: Depends on the implementation.

Q: But what is depends on?

A: The assumptions. If the environment suits best for the assumptions then it will work, with a correct implementation and tests. But if the environment changes and the assumptions don't hold, then the navigation stack won't hold either.
