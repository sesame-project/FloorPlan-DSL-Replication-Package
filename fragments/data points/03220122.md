Q: If you build the map from the construction plan with work better than a noisy map obtained from the sensors?

A: The plans are only plans and may differ from the reality, so we don't use it blindly. The idea is to have a prior that we can adapt with the real measurements. And on top we can add the semantics and topological information to the map to increase the situational awareness.
