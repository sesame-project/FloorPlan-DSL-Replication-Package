Q: What are the elements that describe this environment?

A: It is not easy to describe as there are many machines around. There were small (but significant) height differences between the corridor and each room, that made it challenging to traverse. It is a large open space with many stairs that lead to different corridors and rooms, with no windows. You have doors and machinery. Also a lot of valves. There are also objects that hang from the roof but if the robot is not tall enough it is not relevant. There were also holes in the floor, so certainly it was a very complex environment.
