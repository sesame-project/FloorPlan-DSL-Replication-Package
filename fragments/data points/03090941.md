Q: Can you describe with your own words the navigation stack of one of the robots you have worked with?

A: There were several layers, I worked in the planning part, that consisted in choosing the order of the places the robot would visit to achieve its tasks. The goal was to go to location A to pick up and item, take it to point B, and go to point C. The environment was very dynamic and multi-level, the robot had to use elevators to move between floors. The highlevel layer would need to decompose into smaller middle level path plans. The middle level path were decomposing the goal into smaller sub goals, and the environmental representation used in the project was made so that the plan had incorporated traffic rules, it was important for MRS since you need to coordinate to avoid collisions.

At the lower level there was a need to follow a trajectory. The interesting bit is that the robot needs to be able to reconfigure its kinnematic chain as it can pick up carts which changes the movement constraints.
