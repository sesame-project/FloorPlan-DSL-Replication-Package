Q: What can the navigation stack perceive?

A: Sometimes there are perception modules in the navigation stack, in our case it was simple. We perceived whether or not there was an object in the plane of the laser scanner. But we didn't try to know exactly what was in front the scanner (a person, a wall, an object). We worked only with lasers, but cameras allow you to do more.
