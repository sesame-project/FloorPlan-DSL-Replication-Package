Q: Was there something in the environment that was particularly challenging?

A: The university had glass doors, and was the cause of most of the issues. In the hospital there was a lot of metal, which causes misreadings of the laser lidar. There we also needed to use a elevator, which has lots of challenges. Also, narrow corridors are challenging, but it is very environment dependent.
