Q: Would you say that the problem of navigation in indoor environments is a solved problem?

A: It is considered to be solved in the research community, but I would say it is not entirely solved. The main issue to improve is the motion planning problem. The current implementation of many global planners assumes that the robot is a circle, and this is a strong assumption since the orientation is not computed. While this has not been overlooked by the community at the theoretical level there is little to no implementation available around it (there is no solid bridge between move base and OMPL for various reasons). I believe there is plenty of room for improvement. For the localization, we always need to give it a pose estimate so that it can begin localizing, so it is not truly autonomous. While a service call exists to spread the particles in a random uniform distribution all over the map (something which is supposed to solve the problem) in reality it does not solve the (global localization) problem in a reliable manner.
