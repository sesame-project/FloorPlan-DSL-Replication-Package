Q: When beginning development, how do you approach testing? Simulation first or real-world first?

A: For me it's really real-world. For several reasons, first using/setting up a simulation takes a lot of time, you have to make sure that what you want to test it's representative of the real world. For me it is not worth it most of the time. But in the context of navigation simulations are more helpful than for other applications.
