Q: How would you measure robustness?

A: It's tricky, it depends on the goal of the project. There is no general definition of robustness, it depends on the application and the task, on how you define the optimal behavior. It's complex. What I can say, is that safety should be included in the measure of robustness, but it is hard to measure.

[[Robustness]]
[[Safety]]
