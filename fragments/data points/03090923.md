Q: Did you ever find a bug that was interesting that was related to the environmental features?

A: he canonical (on a real robot) one is wheel slippage, there is no perfect friction with the floor. Sometimes there is a different friction coefficient between the floor and the wheel, and depending on the wheel slip you have a mechanical fault. You fix it with some localization algorithms, to make it more robust. Another bug is related to the pose estimate, in one situation we got confused because the rooms where very similar and gave the wrong pose estimate to the robot navigation. The result was the robot colliding with the table in front of him. Last, I insist on the partial observability, the issue is that depending on the environment many times there are small objects (or big table-like objects) which are not visible by the lidar but instead you only see the legs.
