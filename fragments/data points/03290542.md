Q: Have you worked on the navigation stack of a real or simulated robot?

A: Yes, with both.

Q: What was role in the development process?

A: We develop most of the software. For the simulation we tried to recreate the robot 1:1 with all its elements such as sensors. For indoor navigation I worked mostly with the SLAM algorithm to ensure loop closures. Our goal was to have the autonomous robot to navigate in a way that enable it to explore the environment.

Q: Were you involved in the simulation development?

A: I was, but not completely on my side. My contribution was to improve the simulator software in some aspects.
