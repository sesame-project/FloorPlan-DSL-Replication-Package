Q: Did you ever try to recrate a problem in simulation?

A: It depends on whether or not creating the simulation was going to add a long term benefit. In most cases the answer was not. It required too much effort. Testing in simulation were too small in comparison with test in the real world. In the real world you get to see the real reaction.

It would have been nice to test some things in simulation. Investing time for creating the simulation must bring a lot of benefit to the project. It would have been useful because we needed to test more was the MRS aspect.
