We also deployed robots in industrial spaces, and there the setting was an industrial warehouse with many racks. The main challenge was that many of the features were repeated, so multiple halls would look the same, and that induced some ambiguity, there weren't many unique features to match with. The obstacles were easier to detect because they were larger.
