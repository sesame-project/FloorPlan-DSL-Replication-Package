Q: Was there something in the environment you did not expect that was troublesome?

A: I guess in the university nothing, but in the hospital until we got used to the environment, everything was unexpected. We had to study the way people moved, the way doors open/close, and dynamic elements. You have to see in the environment how the people work in it. There were several things we had to learn.
