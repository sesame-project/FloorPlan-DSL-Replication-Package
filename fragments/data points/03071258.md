Q: How dynamic would you say are the environments?

A: That depends, the most dynamic space was the basement of one of the buildings. In this basement there were movable containers that were parked near the walls of a hallway, so throughout the day every time you map the result is completely different.

More dynamic than containers are persons, and the more dynamic environment we observed was the entry area of a building. It is different dynamic than the previous situation. In particular, a problem was groups waiting for an elevator.
