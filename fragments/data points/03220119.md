Q: Can a software solution deal with these challenges?

A: To deal with these challenges you need to build a deeper understanding of the environment. If there is a window, but the robot cannot see it but it knows about it, even if you can't perceive it you can estimate it. There is also work to be done in sensor fusion. The lidar might not work in an instance, but a camera will, or vice versa.
