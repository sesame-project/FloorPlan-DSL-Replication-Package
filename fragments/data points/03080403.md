Q: Can you describe the environment where you have deployed the robot?

A: Yes, one of the environments was a hospital, which was very structured and rich in semantics. We also worked on robots that are deployed in warehouse type of environments. There are similar structures with large hallways that break into smaller hallways. But if you want to use a laser to measure the environment, there are more distinct features in the hospital than in the warehouse. In the warehouse it was also challenging since the racks have objects that change overtime.
