Q: What does this model entail?

A: Personally I have not written one, but it usually represents the platform at whatever accuracy you require. I have worked with simple models where the robot is modeled with geometric primitives, but I also have worked with a more sophisticated mesh. Most of the time I have worked in simulation, I have worked with a laser.
