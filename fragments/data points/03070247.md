Q: Did you find ant bugs that were surprising? Related to environmental features.

A: Yes. Reflectivity. For instance, the door frames of a building that are made of metal. This had an effect in the distance calculations, and a door frame that in reality has a gap of 80cms, it has a perceived gap of 20cms. Thus, the robot perceives an open door as closed.
