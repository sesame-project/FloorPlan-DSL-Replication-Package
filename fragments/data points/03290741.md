Q: What is the impact of the map quality?

A: We had a very nice map quality, we were able to have a pretty nice loop closure.

Q: Do you think a map that is clean than a noisy map?

A: I think the noisy map is better, as that is how the robot detect it. I would assume that the sensors are going to be noisy.
