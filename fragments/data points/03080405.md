Q: Which elements do you think you need to form the environment?

A: The stable features, the ones that I can rely to localize myself. For instance pillars, which you know they are static. Then you have semi static features, such as carts and boxes, which can be static when you detect them but move in the future. Then you have dynamic obstacles that always move.
