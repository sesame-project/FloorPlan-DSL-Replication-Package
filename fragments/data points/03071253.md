Q: What do you consider as robust?

A: When the robot is able to achieve a task. If the task is to move from pose A to pose B, it should be able to finish the task, even if the solution is not optional. For instance, it could recalculate its path several times, but it finished successfully. So the success rate of the navigation stack is a measure for robustness.
