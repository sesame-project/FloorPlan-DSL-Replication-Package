Q: Which aspects of the environment can cause problems to the navigation stack?

A: It depends on the sensors, for lidar sensor glass or dark materials are challenging. Obstacles and stairs that are not in the field of view can also be dangerous, including small objects such as nails. Water can also be a problem, and we had some in the construction site.
