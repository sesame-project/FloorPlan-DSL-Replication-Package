A: Other thing, sometimes navigation is solved on a 2D level, depending on the height of the sensor sometimes objects are detected. The wall gets detected fine, but we had trashcans attached to the walls that were not detected because they were too high. So the robot assumes that the space is free. We also can use point clounds to detect them, but they are more computationally expensive, you have to deal with much more data. Even then, you still have blind spots. For the navigation you choose a solution that is particular to the environment or application.
