Q: What is the impact of the map quality in the perfomance of the system?

A: It is tightly coupled, very noisy map can affect negatively the performance. There might be areas that the robot cannot go through because it thinks there is an obstacle. It is also important for localization. Too perfect does not reflect reality, so it might not be able to localize. Very perfect maps tends to increse the map between plan and execution, you can find a plan in the perfect map but when executing you can find that is not possible.
