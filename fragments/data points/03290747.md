Q: Would you say the problem of indoor environments is a solved problem?

A: No, there are a lot of issues. First of all, in a production cell that is encaged the robot will only have problems in the area that the robot can perceive and interact with. Some of the stations have collaborating robots outside the cages and must take into acount humans in the environment. Also, for mobile robots that navigate without an external guide, there are problems in staying in the planned paths and avoid crashes.
