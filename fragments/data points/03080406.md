Q: What would you say it's an aspect of the environment that was particularly challenging?

A: One of them is dynamic obstacles, which can include doors. But on the physical part, the unevenness in the floor can be problematic for robots relying on LiDAR. Reflective materials such as glass and metal can also be troublesome, and you "measure" objects that don't exist.
