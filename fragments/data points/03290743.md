Q: How would you describe the simulated environment?

A: Just a simulated environment that is almost 1:1 with the robot and the environment that is going to be deployed in.

Q: Not much different from the 3D world and the real world?

A: We don't simulate the environment exactly. We just simulate the walls. The environment is too complicated and it would take us hours to model each detail.
