Q: How do you approach testing?

A: Depends, but normally we first try to develop in a simulator. In some cases this is very difficult, and depends on the purpose. For visual slam, a realistic simulator is very challenging and is better to work with the real system. For lidar it is easier to work with simulation. If you are working in trajectory planning and control maybe simulation makes more sense.
