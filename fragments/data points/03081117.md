Q: Do you think a software solution can deal with these challenges?

A: I would say a software solution is possible, there are cases where the environment cannot be changed. But the solution doesn't have to be just software, maybe you can also optimize the hardware. In the case of robotics, you have to always think of more than one system to think of a proper solution.
