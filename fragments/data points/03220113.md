Q: Was there something in the environment that was particularly challenging?

A: The robot had lidar, and the most challenging part were windows. Lidars cannot see windows so we had to be careful.

Q: What was the effect of the windows?

A: Depends on the stage of the construction, sometimes the window didn't have the glass pane installed, and sometimes it had. But the laser beam of the lidar sensor goes through glass so it can not get detected. It was dangerous because the robot does not detect it.
