Q: Have you worked in the navigation stack of a real or simulated robot?

A: Yes. In both.

Q: Can you describe your role in the development process?

A: I've worked in many stages of the project, but mainly integration. We used existing techniques for navigation, so we configure the navigation modules but also the simulation. We also wrote new modules for local and global planning.

Q: Are the components you used are the defacto standards?

A: Mostly modules that exist on the community, but we also developed our own. The reason was the existing shortcoming for the current modules, but we wanted to develop components that were a better fit for our application.
