Q: What is the size of this environment?

A: It is an industrial environment, so it was very large with many many rooms. Of course, our test were limited to a zone, that was still very large. Even though it was very large, the SLAM algorithm behaved very good, as the corridors in this environment were so different from other corridors where we have tested the robot. Almost every corridor looks the same, often with not too many features. In this environment there were large but distinct.
