Q: Was there something in the environment you didn't expect when you began testing?

A: Yes, the robot had trouble with bumps and cables in the floor. The robot would not detect a bump/cable, and it would shake enough that it would affect the localization and planner. Sometimes the driver crashes when it came across a bump at high speed.
