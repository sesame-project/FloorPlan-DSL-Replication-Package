Q: Have you found bugs that were related to the environmental features?

A: Yes. The situation about the glass is one. Something similar happens with partially translucent panels such as Plexiglas, those also generate artifacts. It meant that in the map there were obstacles that were not there, not even following the shape of the glass.
