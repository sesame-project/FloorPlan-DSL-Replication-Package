Q: Would you say that the problem of indoor navigation is a solved problem?

A: No. It is solved for certain cases, when a couple of assumptions hold. It works reasonable well is static environments with constant lighting conditions, constant material properties, and control of what objects and persons are moving around. These conditions allows the robot to perform well, but I general it is not a solved problem.
