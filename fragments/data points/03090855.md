Q: Do you have an occupancy you could show?

A: Yes. This is a basic environment with an interesting problem.

A: It is a simple environment without too many complexities. You can see a small doorway around 800mm [sic]. The footprint of the robot allows it to go through the doorway, but you need to be aligned in order to ensure no collisions.

Q: Would you say these problems where unexpected?

A: They were expected once the use case was clear.
