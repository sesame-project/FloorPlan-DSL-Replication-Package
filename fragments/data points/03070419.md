Q: What kind of situations do you think are troublesome?

A: A Laser scanner that is in an environment with glass walls. It is common in spaces such as offices and universities. These element create artifacts in the readings of the lasers due to the refraction of the material, so they are not perceived correctly as solid objects. You also don't sense them as "free spaces", you perceive them as obstacles that are not there. But this situation is present only for laser scanners.
