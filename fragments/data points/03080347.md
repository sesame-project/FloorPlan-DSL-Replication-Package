Q: Can you describe in your own words the navigation stack?

A: I have worked with software stacks for ROS 1 and ROS 2. ROS 1 has deficiencies in local planners, and its de facto software stack was inflexible. ROS 2 planners has more flexibility thanks to the behavior trees. But the problems with planners persist. An improper planner makes the robot lose one degree of freedom.
