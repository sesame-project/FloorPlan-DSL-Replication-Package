Q: Were these robot autonomous or always controlled by someone?

A: The plan was to run them autonomously, but it was not possible to do so due to some failures with the navigation components and the lasers. One challenge we had was that our mapping component would get confused when the laser encountered curtains, ropes, or strings that are hanging from the ceiling.
