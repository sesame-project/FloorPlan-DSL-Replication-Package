Q: What is the difference between the real environment and the simulated environment?

A: The difference we were not that detailed when performing the process in comparison to real life. After building up the complete tooling and preaccepted the design from suppliers, we realized of some issues that we were not aware during the simulation phase. We were not aware of the table size or the size of other things.
