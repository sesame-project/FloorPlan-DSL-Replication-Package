Q: Would you consider this navigation stack robust against the environment?

A: Depends on the environment, in an industrial environment where nothing can be harmed or damaged, we can work on the velocity level. i.e. it is robust. In public spaces (such as hospitals) it is not robust. It takes a lot of time for the robot to navigate. It is also not safe, unless safety controllers are added.
