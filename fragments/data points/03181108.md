Q: What can the navigation stack observe?

A: It should perceive the environment and build an understanding of the situation, at multiple levels of abstraction. So not only understand the geometry of the environment but also semantics and relationship information.

[[Environment]]
[[Geometry]]
[[Semantics]]
[[Environment representation]]
