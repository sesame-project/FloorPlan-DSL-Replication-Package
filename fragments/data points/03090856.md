Q: What other problematic areas can you find in the environment?

A: The map was generated with an algorithm. But a part of the environment was not actually mapped correctly due to incorrect parameters for the algorithm. Without proper parameters some elements of the environment can be not included in the map. For instance, an undetected edge can be the cause of a collision in the future. Building the correct map is a challenge.
