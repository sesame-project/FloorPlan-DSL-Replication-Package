Q: Can you describe in your own words the navigation stack?

A: In general the navigation stack is set of components for localization, plan, and drive the robot to a localization.

Q: What about the navigation stack you developed?

A: For the navigation stack I developed (which was for aero applications) we had a multi-layer approach with multiple systems, you had feature extraction, situational awareness, control, planning, execution, supervision, communication and interaction.
