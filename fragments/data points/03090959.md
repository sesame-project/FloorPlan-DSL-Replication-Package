Q: When beginning development, how did you approach testing? real world or simulation first?

A: By parts, because of the location we did not test often in the target environment. We would test more in a control environment but in the real world. We introduced simulation after, because you need to create the simulation environment which is not easy. It is also not easy when the environment is very large.
