Q: What can the navigation stack observe at the low-level?

A: Ranges and intensities. Lidar sees distances, how far the object is and how reflective is. Same with 3D lidar, and RGB depth cameras. Wheels with odometry/encoders. Sensors that look at the floor and tries to localize using the pattern. GPS in big environments, specially those that are indoor but has outdoor challenges (weather conditions). Wi-Fi strength/beacons used for triangulation.
