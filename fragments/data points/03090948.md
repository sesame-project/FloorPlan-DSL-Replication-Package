Q: Do you have a model for simulation that captures the real world platform?

A: Yes, the model for simulation was always slightly simplified.

Q: What did it entail?

A: Simpler than the physical platform, it was used to test navigation. We had the physical footprint of the robot, the wheels, the kinematic model, the laser scanner, and the normal camera. The simulation model was not able to capture all details.
