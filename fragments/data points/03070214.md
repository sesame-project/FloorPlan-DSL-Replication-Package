Q: And what about a map that is too perfect?

A: For my experience, something that comes from an architectural drawing will perform worse that a map obtained by the sensors. Because this is what the robot sees, you want it to look like it looks to the robot. If you start from an architectural drawing, many things don't look the same. There are irregularities that can be even considered features. And sometimes architectural drawing are really inaccurate. It is also more effort to create a map from an architectural drawing, it might be easier with BIM.
