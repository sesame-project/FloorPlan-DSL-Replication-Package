Q: What environmental features would you like to simulate but it is currently not possible?

A: For me the most challenging to simulate is realism. It is hard to obtain realistic measurements from the simulated sensors that are similar to those obtained by the real robot. I don't think that nowadays is possible, and it is something that has to be dealt with.
