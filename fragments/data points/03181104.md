Q: What were the inputs/sensors the robot used to perceive the environment?

A: It was a generic approach with generic inputs and outputs, and we developed specific components. We were mostly focusing on vision sensors, including RGBD cameras. Since it was for aerial robots, other sensors that come in drone autopilots were also included, such as IMU, magnetometer, etc.
