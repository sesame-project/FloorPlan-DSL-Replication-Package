Q: How dynamic were these spaces?

A: I would say not much. Extremely crowded environments can get you lost very quickly because you only see a lot of human feet around. There was one time when multiple robots were placed in the same area, and this was more dynamic, the robot coped well to our surprise. There are two points of view of dynamics: obstacles and people. Obstacles that are not known to the robot at the time of mapping are also considered dynamic obstacles. Unknown obstacles were part of the robot's environment, and we had to deal with them regularly, the robot was almost always able to do it without problems. We did not dealt with people that much.
