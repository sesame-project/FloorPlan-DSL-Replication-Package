Q: Would you say that the problem of navigation in indoor environments is a solved problem?

A: No.

Q: What are the challenges?

A: For me, the main challenge is that the navigation focuses on the spatial information of the environment through spatial representations, we ignore the semantics of what we see in the environment. It is necessary for more human-like navigation in indoor environments.
