There is more of a problem of robustness the case of the basement. The changes of the position of the containers was so extreme that the localization component was not able to localize the robot or calculate an incorrect pose. At any time a third of the room was covered by something, which makes each map significantly different.

At this point we had no redundancy in the navigation stack, and this was the reason we started to develop it.
