Q: Have you worked on the navigation stack of a real or simulated robot before?

A: Yes. With both.

Q: Can you describe your role in the development process?

A: My role was integrating all the components involved in the navigation process. This included the sensor drivers, the SLAM algorithms, navigation action servers, job scheduling, and user interface. So really the full pipeline from the user's command to the robot execution. I also was responsible of developing some of these components.

Q: Were these components developed by you or were they already available?

A: Most of them were available, we focused on using what was out there.
