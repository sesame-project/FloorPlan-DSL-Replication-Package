Q: Can you describe in your own words the navigation stack you have worked with?

A: I've worked with the "classical" navigation stack, the most widely used. Where you have a map of the environment (grid map), you try to localize yourself in it, and then try to design a path from point A to point B by following a set of poses. You have a local planner that based on the position of the robot in the path, it will determine the velocity commands so that the robot follows through with its plan. In another navigation stack I've worked with we tried to rely less on the accuracy. Also, the environment was divided into sections with semantics. This semantic map allowed us to do planning in the topological level, instead of planning on the occupancy grid. Another layer is in charge of executing the plan, and this one only has to keep track of the local environment. It is important to keep in mind the footprint of the robot when planning to make sure that the movements are safe for the robot to execute, i.e. avoid obstacles. In cases where we didn't have a map, but a goal, with use a combination of methods to steer the robot, such as potential fields.
