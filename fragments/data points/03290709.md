Q: Have you ever found bugs that were interesting related to the environmental features?

A: Yes of course. I must say, a good thing to have a 1:1 simulation of the robot in the environment is that you get to catch the bugs before you test in the real world. The bugs we do not find in simulation are not discovered not because the simulation is inaccurate but due to environmental aspects we did not model. We had problems navigating in the dark, and in one time there was a bench and a chair, and it was hard to operate around it. From the cameras you do not know if the information you are receiving is the most recent frame.
