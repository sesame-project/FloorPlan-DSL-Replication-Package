Q: Any closing remarks?

A: I've missed something about the hardware, I forgot to mentioned the IMU (inertial measurement unit) that is used by components to help localization. Also, in another robot we had two ultra-wide band modules available in the robot base to serve a sort-of indoor GPS system. With two UWB sensors you can compute the robot orientation. Additionally we also tried WiFi localization as part of a course exercise. These sensors can potentially be inputs for navigation, even a RGB camera alone could be used with visual slam and visual odometry approaches, however I have never worked with such approaches.
