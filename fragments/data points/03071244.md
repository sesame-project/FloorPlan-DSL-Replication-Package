Can you describe in your own words the navigation stack? 

Referring to robots that navigate in indoor scenarios, the navigation stack is a layered software stack that has high level component such as path planning (which can be geometry or topologically based), local navigation that uses sensor data to form a grid that helps determine if a desired motion might lead to collisions, and controllers that control the actuators to execute a motion plan. In addition, a localization component that gives you the pose of the robot with respect to the map of the environment
