Would you consider the navigation stack robust against the environment?

I would say yes, since it has a lot redundancy. We have different sensors of different modalities that can sense multiple things. For localization we are able to use 2D SLAM and 3D SLAM. Everything can still fail, but redundancy brings a lot robustness.
