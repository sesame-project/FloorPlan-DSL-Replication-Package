Q: What environmental features would you like to simulate but are not currently possible?

A: Movement of plants, although not needed. The main thing that I would like to simulate is a person walking around the environment. I've seen some examples but I'm not sure how easy it is to use. I would like to be able to just give some navigation goals (like you do for the robot) to the human, and for the actor to move to the spot in a realistic way. Maybe also use multiple humans in one environment. Another thing would be to be able to simulate humas in a better way to be able e.g to hand over tools to him, etc. This would greatly help to try HRI algorithms in the simulator.
