Q: Was there something in the environment you did not expect?

A: In one situation I would say no (apart from objects accidentally dropped to the floor by the robot), in general the environments we worked on were controlled and static, even if they did change the layout of the space. Sometimes the platform material changed but it didn't caused much trouble.
