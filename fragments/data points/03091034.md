Q: What environmental features would you like to simulate but it is not possible?

A: It would be nice to simulate everything that is interesting. I could not simulate people for the case application, because the task depending on the pose of the people. I had a problem that I could not see until I moved away from simulation that was related to the person detection, since I could not detect humans I could not detect the problem.
