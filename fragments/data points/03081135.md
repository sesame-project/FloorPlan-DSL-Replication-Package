Q: Can you describe in your own words the navigation stack you have worked with?

A: There is mapping, we worked with a traditional map server with some custom map servers. Also, there was a different type of map in another project which added semantics. For localization we used standard tools such as AMCL or variants, and for navigation itself I worked with the standard packages, but also worked with custom algorithms. On the hardware side, I worked with different robots, but most of them were omnidirectional and used a 2D laser scanner. Sometimes it also has 3D Lidar lasers and sometimes we used a RGBD camera.
