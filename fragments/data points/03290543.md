Q: Would you say that the problem of navigation in indoor environments in a solved problem?

A: No

Q: What are the challenges?

A: There are many. The challenges depend on the type of sensors you use. If you only use lasers then autonomous navigation is very challenging, as the 2D laser has limited observability and you can only see objects at a certain level. In one example we had a structure that the laser would not detect that was impossible for the robot to fit. The choice of the sensor is very important. Most algorithms work in 2D, so navigating in a 3D world is challenging.
