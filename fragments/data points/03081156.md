Q: Do you think a software solution can deal with these challenges?

A: I suppose that modifying the environment would make things easier, but it depends on the application if its acceptable. If it's not acceptable a software solution can also deal with the issues but it's trickier. Changing the environment can make localization easier, but if you have to deal with the issues on software you need to take many aspects into account. It can be done, but it is harder and requires a combination of models and algorithms.
