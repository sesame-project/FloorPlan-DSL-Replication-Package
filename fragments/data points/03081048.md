Q: Can you describe in your own words the navigation stack?

A: There are four components: One is the mapping, the localization component, the global planner, and the local planner. The global planner is in charge of planning the path between two locations in the space that avoids the known obstacles in the map, the local planner is in charge of handling the errors of the map and dynamic obstacles, and try to prune the global path. These are the four basic components.
