Q: What can the navigation stack perceive?

A: Different types of objects, like walls or doors. It can also see more challenging objects such as small objects and overhang objects. Small objects are objects that are below the 2D plane of the laser scanner, hence we have 3D cameras. Same for overhang objects such as large tables.
