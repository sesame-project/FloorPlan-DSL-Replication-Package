Q: How would you describe the environment for the simulation? What is different between the real and simulated world.

A: A least with the test we performed in simulation did not include glass materials, it is usally a simplified version of the environment. You place walls, normal walls, even when you have glass walls in the real environments. Also dynamic obstacles are not added to the simulation, so it's really simplified.
