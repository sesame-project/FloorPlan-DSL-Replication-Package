Q: Would you consider this navigation stack robust against the environment?

A: To a certain extend yes, but not fully

Q: What do you consider as robust?

A: For instance, for a robot that is about a meter tall with a laser scanner not so far from the ground, a generated occupancy grid map will not detect overhanging structures (e.g. long tables). This are obstacles that the robot cannot perceive, making their deployment in the environment unsafe. This problem cannot be solved with a single laser scanner, it is a corner case. You have to think of way that allow the robot to avoid this types of obstacles/areas.
