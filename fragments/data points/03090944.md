Q: What makes the stack robust?

A: This was part of the software stack developed through the project but wasn't exclusive to navigation. There was a mechanism to escalate failures from lower level components to higher level components. If you had a failure on the sensor, then the component that depended on it would get notified, for instance localization, and the recovery action was performed. If it didn't worked, it would get scalated to the next level.
