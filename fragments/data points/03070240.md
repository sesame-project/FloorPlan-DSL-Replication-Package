Q: What can make localization difficult? On top of glass walls.

A: Clutter (like furniture) after mapping. The robot will see the furniture and will be able to avoid it, but the localization module will be confused. Dynamic obstacles cause the same problem, or adds to the problem. Also faulty odometry.
