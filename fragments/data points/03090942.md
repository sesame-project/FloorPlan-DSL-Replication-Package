Q: What would be the inputs and outputs of the navigation stack?

A: there was a component that included semantic information in the occupancy grid, and topological subdivisions. As inputs we had the original occupancy grid, the environment representation (with semantics), the tasks (location to pick up and deliver), we had a task planner, the state of the robot, and the current location. As outputs we had feedback about when the robot reached a specific position to track progress, we also had feedback about attempts (e.g. to reach a location), and a final feedback on whether or not the nav stack was able to reach the goal.
