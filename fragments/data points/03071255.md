Q: Do you have a model for the robot platform for simulation?

A: Yes, we have one for two simulators.

Q: What does it entail?

A: All the kinematic aspects of the platform, all the actuators (which movements can be simplified in simulation), and all the sensors. Several types of sensors can be simulated and recreate closely the behaviour of the real world, we can simulate 2D and 3D lidar, 3D cameras, RGB cameras, etc.
