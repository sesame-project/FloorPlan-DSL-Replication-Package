Q: How do you approach testing? Simulation first or real-world first?

A: I like to work with the real world better. The simulation is not that accurate, or not accurate enough to represent most situations. Most of the effort was directed towards the real robot. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we decided to invest more time to make the simulation better. I now work mostly with the simulated robot.
